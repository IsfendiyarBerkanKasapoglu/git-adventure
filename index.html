    <h1>Git Quiz</h1>
    <h4>What is Git and why is it so important?</h4>
    Git is the most commonly used version control system. Git tracks the changes you make to files, so you have a record of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to.  
    <h4>What’s a branch and why do we create them?</h4>
    A branch represents an independent line of development. Branches serve as an abstraction for the edit/stage/commit process. 
    <h4>What’s the working tree?</h4>
    The working tree, or working directory, consists of files that you are currently working on.
    <h4>What’s the staging area?</h4>
    The staging area is like a rough draft space, it's where you can git add the version of a file or multiple files that you want to save in your next commit (in other words in the next version of your project).
    <h4>What’s the command to retrieve the latest version of your files from the remote serve?</h4>
    git pull
